    "#  Project 1: Data Analysis and Visualization with Real-Life Marine Litter Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's combine everything we have learned so far to work on a real life dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset provides valuable information about marine litter found at the seafloor of the southeastern North Sea. It was collected during scientific research aimed at understanding the distribution and impact of marine litter in this area. Here's a breakdown of the dataset description and its columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Citation:** The dataset is attributed to Lars Gutow and published by the Alfred Wegener Institute. It is part of a larger study that investigates marine litter in the North Sea. The dataset can be accessed through the provided DOI link (https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.890785)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Location:** The dataset is specific to the North Sea.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Campaign:** The specific research campaign under which this data was collected was \"HE419\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Method/Device:** A beam trawl (BEAM) was used to collect marine litter data from the seafloor.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Columns:\n",
    "- **Station:** This identifies the specific sampling station where the data was collected.\n",
    "- **Date/Time:** The exact date and time of the sampling at the station.\n",
    "- **Latitude:** The geographic latitude of the sampling point.\n",
    "- **Longitude:** The geographic longitude of the sampling point.\n",
    "- **Elevation [m]:** The depth at which the sampling occurred, measured in meters.\n",
    "- **Litter obj:** This column likely records the specific litter object(s) found during sampling.\n",
    "- **Litter cat:** This column categorizes the types of litter objects identified.\n",
    "- **Litter fish:** This column may provide additional information regarding litter impacts on fish species or related observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is crucial for understanding marine pollution in the North Sea. It documents the types and quantities of litter found at various depths and locations, which can help researchers assess the impact of marine litter on marine ecosystems and contribute to environmental management efforts. The detailed metadata allows for effective spatial and temporal analyses, enabling scientists to track changes over time and identify potential sources of pollution."
